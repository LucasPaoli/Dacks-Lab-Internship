# README : HOW TO USE THESE SCRIPTS

In addition to the all these scripts, you will need the executables (see Script header) and PR2 and SILVA databases.


First run the script "Script_usearch_version.sh". Make sure to check the header of the script and change the variables to the appropriate values

The "Script_usearch.R" script should be called automatically. If not, run the script "Script_usearch.R" as follows : *Rscript Script_usearch.R /Path/to/Output-Directory/*

If you had to run the "Script_usearch.R" script manually then run the script "Filter.sh" as follows : *./Filter.sh /Path/to/Output-Directory/*

You can now move to the ecological analysis
